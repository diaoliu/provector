# Path

## What is Path

The path object contains a sequence of connected anchor points, which are joined by cubic bezier curves (straight or curved segments) .

Here are a few key aspects of paths:

- **Anchor Points**: the starting and ending points of the curve segments.
- **Bezier Handles**: the control points determine the tangent and curvature of the curve segments.
- **Curve Segments**: these are the bezier curves that connect the anchor points.

## Draw Basic Shapes

## Edit Paths with the Direct Selection Tool

To activate the direct selection tool, you can either

- Click the direct selection tool in the toolbar
- Or press <kbd>ctrl/command</kbd> while drawing paths using the pen tool.

<Callout>
**Modifier Keys**

- <kbd>shift</kbd> constrain the angle to multiples of 45 degrees or snap to the
  tangent of curve segments.
- <kbd>alt/option</kbd> drag the handle individually, it helps you to convert a smooth point to a corner.
</Callout>

### Remove Anchor Points

Unlike deleting points from the paths, this command removes also the curve segments the points belong to.

Select one or more anchor points, then do one of the following:

- Press <kbd>backspace</kbd> or <kbd>delete</kbd> on the keyboard.
- Click **Remove Anchor Points** in the anchors panel.

### Convert to Corner Points

To clear the handles of the selected points, select one or more points, then do one of the following:

- Hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> and click at an anchor point.
- Click **Convert to Corner Points** in the anchors panel to convert all selected points to corner.

### Convert to Smooth Points

To add two collinear handles to form a smooth point, select one or more points, then do one of the following:

- Hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> and click at an anchor point.
- Click **Convert to Smooth Points** in the anchors panel to convert all selected points to smooth.

### Cut Paths

To open a closed path or split paths at selected anchor points:

1. Select one or more anchor points.
2. With the direct selection tool active, in the anchors panel, click **Cut Paths**.

### Join Paths

   - **Preview**: enable the preview checkbox to offset the paths in real-time.

4. Once you have set the options, click the "OK" button to create offset paths.

## Smooth Paths
