### SVG

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is XML-based vector image format for describing two-dimensional graphics, mixed with raster images and texts. SVG images are compact and can be scaled in any size without loss of quality. Futhermore, you can open and edit the exported SVG images in Provector or other vector graphics editors.

### PNG

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is raster graphic file format that supports lossless compression and transparency. PNG format keeps original image quality and reduces file size significantly depends on the number of colors that the image has. So if you only want to export vector graphics to raster images, PNG is a better choice than JPEG and WebP format.

### JPEG

JPG (Joint Photographic Group) is a widely used raster graphic file format with lossy compression. JPG file does not support transparency, but its compression degree can be adjusted to archive a balance between file size and image quality.

### WebP

WebP is developed by Google to replace PNG and JPEG images on the web. It supports both lossy and lossless compression, as well as alpha transparency. According to Google's evaluation, a WebP file is averagely 25%-34% smaller than a JPEG file. So you want to export your artworks for web, WebP is widely supported by the most of the modern browsers, so it might be the best solution for exporting your artworks to use them on the web.

## Export Settings

### Resolution
